description: Learn how to add author showcase pages to your documentation with the Starlight Showcases component library.
---

A set of [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) components to author showcase pages for your documentation.

Different type of showcase items can be displayed, such as [text](/components/text/), [images](/components/images/), [YouTube videos](/components/youtube/), [Twitter posts](/components/twitter/), and [quotes](/components/quotes/).

Check out the [demo](/demo/) for a preview of the components in action.

:::note[Credits]
All credits go to [Chris Swithinbank (@delucis)](https://github.com/delucis/) for the original idea and implementation in the [Starlight documentation](https://starlight.astro.build/resources/showcase/) and also creating the [Astro Embed](https://astro-embed.netlify.app/) library used in this project.
:::

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

## Installation

Install the Starlight Showcases component library using your favorite package manager:

import { PackageManagers } from 'starlight-package-managers'

<PackageManagers pkg="starlight-showcases" />

## Basic Usage

You can now use any of the components in your MDX files.

```mdx title="src/content/docs/showcase.mdx"
import { ShowcaseText } from 'starlight-showcases'

<ShowcaseText
  entries={[
    {
      href: 'https://github.com/HiDeoo/starlight-links-validator',
      title: 'starlight-links-validator',
      description: 'Check for broken links in your Starlight pages.',
    },
  ]}
/>
```

For more details and examples, please refer to each component's documentation or the [demo](/demo/) for a preview of the components in action.
