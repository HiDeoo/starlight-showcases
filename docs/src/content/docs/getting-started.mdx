## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

## Installation

Install the Starlight Showcases component library using your favorite package manager:

import { PackageManagers } from 'starlight-package-managers'

<PackageManagers pkg="starlight-showcases" />

## Basic Usage

You can now use any of the components in your MDX files.

```mdx title="src/content/docs/showcase.mdx"
// TODO(HiDeoo)
import { PackageManagers } from 'starlight-package-managers'

// TODO(HiDeoo)
```
