A set of [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) components to author showcase pages for your documentation.

Different type of showcase items can be displayed, such as [text](/components/text/), [images](/components/images/), [YouTube videos](/components/youtube/), [Twitter posts](/components/twitter/), and [quotes](/components/quotes/).

Check out the [demo](/demo/) for a preview of the components in action.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

## Installation

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'
import { PackageManagers } from '@hideoo/starlight-plugins-docs-components'

<Steps>

1. Install the Starlight Showcases component library using your favorite package manager:

   <PackageManagers pkg="starlight-showcases" />

2. Use any of the components in your MDX files.

   ```mdx title="src/content/docs/showcase.mdx"
   import { ShowcaseText } from 'starlight-showcases'

   <ShowcaseText
     entries={[
       {
         href: 'https://github.com/HiDeoo/starlight-links-validator',
         title: 'starlight-links-validator',
         description: 'Check for broken links in your Starlight pages.',
       },
     ]}
   />
   ```

3. [Start the development server](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/#start-the-development-server) to preview the components.

</Steps>
